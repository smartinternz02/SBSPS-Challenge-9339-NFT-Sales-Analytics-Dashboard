NFT Sales Analytics Dashboard
The NFT market is booming now. According to NFTGO statistics, at least one NFT project has launched on chain every day since May 2021. 
In the world of blockchain, whether as an investor or a beginner, you can rely on data to stay away from “hearsay” and decide which NFT to buy by yourself. 
Analytics dashboards and reports can be created to know more about NFT. By using analytics tools to identify patterns and discrepancies, traders, builders, and collectors can gain a competitive edge in a brand new market.
